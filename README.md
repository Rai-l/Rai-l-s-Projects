The project is created to be a simple and basic playlist manager for audios focusing on user interface and the use of dictionary via JSON files and tkinter library.

The current version of the project can:
-takes in user input for 'create a playlist', indexing 'name':'directory'
-creates a container that displays the 'name' and 'directory' of each index in the dictionary stored in the JSON file as well as a 'play audio' button each time the software is opened up
-a 'loop all' button that plays all the audio in the dictionary stored in the JSON file

Future plans:
-drop down box instead of user input/ a specific directory that stores audio files
-more focus on the style of the software, ect.
